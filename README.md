# BOOKSTORE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
A Book Inventory System is a comprehensive platform designed for managing the operations of libraries, bookstores, and any organization dealing with book inventory. This system uses a Database Management System (DBMS) to efficiently track, organize, and maintain information about books, users, and transactions.

# Features
Cataloging: Maintains complete metadata for all books, making it easy to search, retrieve, and organize inventory.

Tracking: Monitors the real-time status and location of books (available, checked out, reserved, etc.).

User Management: Manages customer or borrower details and purchase/borrowing history.

Transactions Management: Records book loans, returns, sales, and reservations accurately.

Reporting: Generates reports on inventory levels, borrowing and sales patterns, and other business metrics for data-driven decision making.

# Key Relationships
Book ↔ Author: Many-to-Many (One book can have multiple authors, and one author can write multiple books)

Book ↔ Publisher: Many-to-One (Each book has one publisher)

Customer ↔ Order: One-to-Many (A customer can place multiple orders)

Order ↔ Book: Many-to-Many (Each order can include multiple books and each book can be included in multiple orders)
